\section{Background}\label{background}

Most low-income countries have reported to have either no data or have registered less than 50\% of deaths in their country, where only 8\% of these deaths have a Cause of Death (COD) recorded \cite{worldhealthorganizationSCOREHealthData2021}. To increase the number of records with a COD, a method known as Verbal Autopsy (VA) is used to determine likely causes for deaths outside of healthcare facilities. VA involves trained interviewers that speak to those familiar with the deceased to gather information based on standard questionnaires and open narratives, and medical professionals that evaluate the information to assign probable CODs \cite{worldhealthorganizationVerbalAutopsyStandards2023}.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\section{Section title of first appendix}\label{secA1}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.

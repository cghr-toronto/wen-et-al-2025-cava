\section{Background}\label{background}

In 2019, 41 million people die prematurely from noncommunicable diseases every year, accounting for 74\% of all deaths globally \cite{worldhealthorganizationNonCommunicableDiseases2019}. Most of these deaths are preventable and treatable, but require adequate resources, interventions, and policies, such as access to primary care, health insurance, healthier diets, and advanced screening procedures \cite{benzigerGlobalBurdenDisease2016}. Reliable counts and diagnosis of deaths are crucial for public health planning and policy making --- guiding scalable interventions that save lives and reduce premature deaths worldwide \cite{lawnMillionNeonatalDeaths2010,lassiCommunityBasedIntervention2015,liuExcessMortalityPersons2017,ewigCommunityacquiredPneumoniaEmergency2011}. However, most low-income countries do not have data on deaths or registered less than half of the deaths in their country, with an even fewer 8\% of these registered deaths having a Cause of Death (COD) recorded \cite{worldhealthorganizationSCOREHealthData2021}. To fill this gap in death registrations, an alternative method known as Verbal Autopsy (VA) is used to collect data on deaths and determine their likely causes at scale \cite{desavignyIntegratingCommunitybasedVerbal2017,thomasVerbalAutopsyHealth2018,rampatigeSystematicReviewStatistics2014}, outside of traditional healthcare facilities where over half of the deaths occur at home \cite{adairWhoDiesWhere2021}.

VA involves two major components: survey and COD assignment \cite{worldhealthorganizationVerbalAutopsyStandards2023}. In the survey component, trained lay surveyors interview those familiar with the deceased (e.g. living spouse, children, family, friends) to gather information using standardized questionnaires and open narratives. In the COD assignment component, physicians evaluate information available from the questionnaires and open narratives to assign probable CODs. Although the survey component has been an effective alternative to collect mortality data at scale, the COD assignment component has been criticized to be expensive and difficult to reproduce due to reliance on physician assigned CODs \cite{mccormickProbabilisticCauseofDeathAssignment2016,morrisFactorsAssociatedPhysician2010}. Recently, computer algorithms have been studied to automatically assign CODs, as an alternative to physician assignment, with performances close to physicians at the population level, but poor performances at the individual level \cite{}. Many of these computer algorithms have utilized the questionnaire portion of the surveyed data, but often omit data from the open narrative.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

The Introduction section, of referenced text \cite{bib1} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the typeset article if it is accepted.

\section{Methods}\label{sec11}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work. Authors are encouraged to include RIIDs where appropriate. 

\textbf{Ethical approval declarations} (only required where applicable) Any article reporting experiment/s carried out on (i)~live vertebrate (or higher invertebrates), (ii)~humans or (iii)~human samples must include an unambiguous statement within the methods section that meets the following requirements: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Approval: a statement which confirms that all experimental protocols were approved by a named institutional and/or licensing committee. Please identify the approving body in the methods section

\item Accordance: a statement explicitly saying that the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations

\item Informed consent (for experiments involving humans or human tissue samples): include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardian/s
\end{enumerate}

If your manuscript includes potentially identifying patient/participant information, or if it describes human transplantation research, or if it reports results of a clinical trial then  additional information will be required. Please visit (\url{https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies}) for Nature Portfolio journals, (\url{https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/publishing-ethics/14214}) for Springer Nature journals, or (\url{https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies\#ethics+and+consent}) for BMC.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\section{Section title of first appendix}\label{secA1}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.
